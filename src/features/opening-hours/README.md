# Opening Hours

## Overview

The Opening Hours feature manages the business operating hours for each day of the week. It is a global setting.

## Queries (Read Operations)

### Data Structure

The `opening-hours` feature is implemented as a **Collection** with the slug `opening-hours`.

### Fields

- **startDate** (date, required): The date from which these opening hours apply. The system will always use the document with the most recent `startDate` that is in the past (or today).
- **monday** (group)
  - **open** (text): Opening time (e.g., "09:00")
  - **close** (text): Closing time (e.g., "18:00")
  - **isOpen** (checkbox): Whether the place is open on this day
- **tuesday**... **sunday** (same structure as monday)

## Usage

The feature exposes a `getOpeningHours` function that returns the currently active opening hours based on the server's date.

```typescript
import { getOpeningHours } from "@/src/features/opening-hours/queries/openingHours";

const openingHours = await getOpeningHours();
```
